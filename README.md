# Galvanize Message

## Important Note

This is a timed assessment.  You should be able to complete it in under 3 hours.  Remember to commit and push to your forked repository. At the very least, you should commit after each test passes. We will use the timestamps to evaluate how long it took.

## Project Description

The app is a simple message board.

### Requirements

You are responsible for:

- [ ] Forking and cloning this GitHub Repo.
- [ ] Database Migration.
- [ ] Database Seed Data.
- [ ] RESTful API to handle messages resource.
- [ ] Client website that enables all CRUD functionality for messages resource. *You can decide what form the client website takes.*
- [ ] Deployment of full stack app on Heroku.

**TIP: Make the site functional before you make it pretty. Functional html pages are sufficient for the 3-hour requirement.**


### Tests

We have provided tests to help you build the database migrations, seeds and routes.  *Use them.* If you are unsure of what the test is asking for, open the test and read it. You can ask an instructor for test clarifications.

At the command line type `npm test` to run the tests.

**TIP: When testing your migrations you may need to drop and recreate your database before running the test so that your migration changes are reflected in the database.**

### Messages Object

You need to create routes, seed data and migrations for the following object.

```javascript
[{
	id:1,
  	name:'Criminal',
  	message:'What Are You?'
},{
	id:2,
    name:'Batman',
    message:'I\'m Batman'
}]
```
